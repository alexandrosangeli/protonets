# protonets

A (yet another) neural network framework built in Python from scratch.

## Aims
Provide support for implementing three basic neural network architectures:
- MLP
- CNN
- RNN

### What this is
- An attempt to better understand how NN frameworks may work, including autograd.
- Curosioty treatment
  
### What this is not
- Either an optimised (w.r.t performance) or fully functional NN framework.
